# RWBY Project - General Description
#The main purpose of this project is to apply the newly learned skills of HTML and CSS to create a website. This website provides information on the animated series called RWBY, and it was created through a local server.

#Project Direction
1) Website Layout - A general layout of the entire website is created first. This layout includes what type of information should be included on each page. The information can range from a summary of RWBY to descriptions of characters. It also containes a sample structure and artistic elements of the website. This layout is named "RWBY Website Layout" on Github. 
2) Website - Information on RWBY is then gathered through multiple sources, and the website is coded at the time. The final project follows the website layout for the most parts although some details might change. Four pages created are called "Home Page", "Main Characters", "Behind the Scene", and "Project Information." A folder called "RWBY Images" contains images used during this project.
